# Module 1 - Installing and exploring FAST

The deployed BIG-IP does not have FAST installed. This needs to be accomplished first before it can be explored and used.

**Task 1:** Install the latest version of FAST by using the [instructions](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-appsvcs-templates/latest/userguide/install-uninstall.html#installation) from Clouddocs.

**Task 2:** Explore the FAST GUI at the BIG-IP and use Clouddocs ["FAST GUI Overview"](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-appsvcs-templates/latest/userguide/using-app-templates.html#gui-overview) section to understand the usefulness of the provided tabs.

**Note:** The BIG-IP FAST GUI can be found via **iApps > Application Services > Applications LX**. `Select` **F5 Application Services Templates**.

**Taks 3:** Go to the FAST GUI and `select` the tab **FAST Templates** and explore the different types of FAST templates.

**Question:**
Would you use a FAST 'examples' template in production?
